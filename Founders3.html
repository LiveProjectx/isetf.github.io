Her aim is to help children and adults all over the world to learn systemic thinking in a playful way and to develop curricula together, to develop themselves further together and to increase intelligence and efficient communication as a global community in cooperation with artificial intelligence on the online platform to build  "FORMWELT Online".</p>

                        Gitta Peyn is co-founder of the FORMWELTen-Institut, Germany, which specializes in promoting innovative systemic and cybernetic thinking.

He is working on C. elegans model system, which is employed for the studies because of its immense genetic relevance; it exhibits appreciable homology of gene sequences with that of humans, is accessible for carrying out genetic manipulations and presents with multiple disease pathways that are conserved across the taxa.</p><p> The first ever-genetic understanding of Alzheimer’s disease came from research with C. elegans that led to identification of Presenilin-1 (orthologue of C. elegans sel-12). C. elegans was the first multi-cellular organism to have it genome mapped and the process of RNAi induced gene silencing was first discovered in this model. Work with C. elegans has resulted in award of Nobel Prize to six scientists for their pioneering work that has significantly aided in understanding of multiple biological processes including understanding of various human disease conditions.</p>
